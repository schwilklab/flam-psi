# Water status and shrub flammability

## Project goals

- What are the relationships between water potential, LFMC, and flammability, and do they vary across species?
- If the relationship between water status and flammability varies across species, which plant traits predict the strength of this relationship?

## Data analysis and scripts

All the data analyses were performed in R with all scripts in
scripts/. To reproduce the results, please read run-all.R script. The task need to perform before
running each script is documented at the beginning of each script.
