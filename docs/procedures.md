# General guidelines
    - Enter all data directly into the appropriate spreadsheet found on the shared OneDrive folder 
    - Water potential project > data > spreadsheets for data entry > FMC_data > [specific spreadsheet]
    - Use the analytical balance for FMC weighing
    - the one with (one with the glass box and sliding glass doors)
    - Use plastic weigh boat
    - Use VWR (model #: VWP-2002B2T) for fresh and dry weighing
    - Use metal tray as weigh boat
    - Calibrate the balances before each weighing session 
        1. use 0.100 g weight for Denver Instrument and 300 g weight for the VWR
        2. Add weight reading to “Water potential project outline” (in “documents” folder)

# Procedure

    1. Record any data (fresh mass, dry mass etc.) on envelope or bag into appropriate columns on the correct spreadsheet
    2. For FMC (paper envelopes); fresh and dry weight is written on the envelope For fresh samples:
    3. Tare weigh boat on analytical balance
    4. Add all fresh plant material to weigh boat
    5. Allow balance to stop changing readings and record weight (g) directly into appropriate data entry spreadsheet
        a. For FMC/analytical balance, record to the third decimal place. E.g., 1.342 g For dry samples:
    6. Place all fresh plant material back into its paper bag or envelope
    7. Dried in an oven for 48 hours at 65 °C
    8. Add all dry plant material to weigh boat
        a. Ensuring no plant material is left in envelope
    9. Ensuring no plant material is touching any part of the balance itself
    10. Allow balance to stop changing readings and record weight (g) directly into appropriate data entry spreadsheet
    11. Place all plant material back into its paper bag or coin envelope
        a. Mark each envelop or bag with “weighed” and the date and place in large paper bag marked “weighed”
